# GoldenSteam

Sets an account's persona state flags to an undocumented value that causes its
name and avatar border to be displayed in the same golden border as those who
won the 2014 holiday auction.  Releasing this publically since others have
already done so and there's no point to keeping it secret anymore.

To run:
```
npm install steam-user
npm install prompt
node main.js
```
